Notes on Lecture 5

This is just some notes of things I found interesting
L.append(e) -- mutates L, i.e. a side effect

Concatenate through append -- modifies the old list, does not produce a new one

Must say, I really like Python, cool computer language. I wonder how Julia is in comparison.

Mutation vs. changing the binding

Dictionary differs from a list in two ways
1. Items need not be ordered
2. Indices (keys) need not be integers -- the keys can be any immutable type

Set of key value pairs, access it by looking at the keys
Dictionaries are sets, not sequences -- they don't have a specific order.

Keys need to be immutable!
