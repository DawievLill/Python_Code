#A function is a named sequence of statements that performs a desired operation

#Can make up any name for the functions that you create
#Can be any nmber of statements inside a function

#An example of what a function looks like, without parameters

def new_line():
    print

#Function is named new_line
#Defining a new function does not make it run!
## We need a FUNCTION CALL...
## Contains the same name as the function

print "First line"
new_line()
print "Second line"

#You get the idea, in fact I have done this before.
#Function has to be created before it can be called.

##Flow of execution
#Statements inside the function are not executed until the function is called
