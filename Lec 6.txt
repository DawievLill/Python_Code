Notes on Lecture 6

Dictionaries continued...

Keys can be a string, a tuple, etc. Very versatile. 

Different data structures have different costs

Divide and conquer
	Small problems are easier to solve
	Solutions to small problems can easily be combined to solve the orginal problem

Recursion (new technique)
	Way of describing problems
	Way of designing solutions

Base case
	Typically the direct answer

Inductive (recursive) case
	Reduce to a simpler version of the same problem plus other single operations

Tower of Hanoi problem
